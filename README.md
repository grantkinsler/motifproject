This the documentation for the following paper:
Title: Selection for motifs in a model of template-free elongation of polymers within compartments.
Authors: Grant Kinsler*, Sam Sinai*, Nicholas Keone Lee, Martin A. Nowak
*Equal contribution to the work

The various directories encapsulate the programs used to generate the data for the paper. Documentation for each simulation is provided in the directory.

Under the data directory the files are:

newleaf_compiled_data.csv contains the steady-state motif frequencies, non-empty strand frequencies, and frequency of cells with at least one motif (with standard error) for runs with each combination of parameters tested of the simulations with only one active motif.

newleaf_compete_compiled_data.csv contains the same information for runs with pairs of motifs being active (competing and cooperating cases).

Data depicting the elongation patterns shown in Figures 3, 5, S2, S3, S4 as well as the raw data directly from our simulations is not uploaded here to due the large number and size of the files. This data available upon request to grantkinsler[at]gmail[dot]com. The data underlying these figures is contained in very large files, and thus difficult to upload to a publicly accessible repository. 

iPython notebooks used to generate the figures shown in the manuscript are available in the data_processing directory.
